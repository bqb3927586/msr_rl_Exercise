I would like to select Reinforcement Learning for LLVM Phase Ordering as my compiler optimization tasks. There are several reasons as follows.

1. I can use my knowledge on reinforcement learning on this project and I have been working on RL algorithms for over two years.
2. Facebook Research provided plenty of API and document for the LLVM environment, which makes it easy to start in a short time.
3. According to the leaderboards in the ComplierGym Github, it seems there are few RL results for this optimization problem and there should exist space to improve the result.
